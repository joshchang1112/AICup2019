# AICup_2019_Tagging-of-Thesis

## Introduction

How do you design a system that could appropriately analyze the algorithms used in a thesis? With the rapid innovation of computing technology, human work of theses tagging and classification has proven to be ever more inefficient and unfeasible. Inevitably, the employment of computers in the work of theses analysis would be a major attempt to reducing human workload, and could allow researchers to focus in more important and meaningful tasks.
The aim of this competition is to attempt to solve a problem that has troubled researchers for long: “How do you design a system that could automatically analyze the abstract of a thesis and summarize utilized, compared, or newly proposed algorithm used within the theses?”
